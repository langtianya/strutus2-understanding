The vote will remain open for at least 72 hours, longer upon request. A vote can be amended at any time to upgrade or downgrade the quality of the release based on future experience. If an initial vote designates the build as &quot;Beta&quot;, the release will be submitted for mirroring and announced to the user list. Once released as a public beta, subsequent quality votes on a build may be held on the user list.

As always, the act of voting carries certain obligations. A binding vote not only states an opinion, but means that the voter is agreeing to help do the work

<PRE>Subject: [ANN] Struts #.#.# [GA | Beta] release available
</PRE>
</DIV></DIV>

<DIV class="preformatted panel" style="border-width: 1px;"><DIV class="preformattedContent panelContent">
<PRE>The Apache Struts group is pleased to announce that Struts #.#.# is available as a &quot;[Beta | General Availability]&quot; release. [[The Beta designation indicates that we believe the distribution needs wider testing before being upgraded to a &quot;General Availability&quot; release. Your input is essential.] The GA designation is our highest quality grade.]

Apache Struts 2 is an elegant, extensible framework for creating enterprise-ready Java web applications. The framework is designed to streamline the full development cycle, from building, to deploying, to maintaining applications over time.

[This release includes one important security fix:]

All developers are strongly advised to update existing Struts 2 applications to Struts #.#.#.

Struts #.#.# is available in a full distribution, or as separate library, source, example and documentation distributions, from the releases page.
* http://struts.apache.org/download.cgi#struts###

The release is also available from the central Maven repository under Group ID &quot;org.apache.struts&quot;.

The #.#.x series of the Apache Struts framework has a minimum requirement of the following specification versions:
* Java Servlet 2.4 and JavaServer Pages (JSP) 2.0
* Java 2 Standard Platform Edition (J2SE) 5

The release notes are available online at:
* http://struts.apache.org/2.x/docs/version-notes-###.html

Should any issues arise with your use of any version of the Struts framework, please post your comments to the user list, and, if appropriate, file a tracking ticket.appropriate, file a tracking ticket:
* https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/WW

Everyone who has tested the build is invited to vote. Votes by PMC members are considered binding. A vote passes if there are at least three binding +1s and more +1s than -1s.

This is a &quot;fast-track&quot; release vote. If we have a positive vote after 24 hours (at least three binding +1s and more +1s than -1s),  the release may be submitted for mirroring and announced to the usual channels.

The website download link will include the mirroring timestamp parameter [1], which limits the selection of mirrors to those that have been refreshed since the indicated time and date. (After 24 hours, we \*must\* remove the timestamp parameter from the website link, to avoid unnecessary server load.) In the case of a fast-track release, the email announcement will not link directly to &lt;download.cgi&gt;, but to &lt;downloads.html&gt;, so that we can control use of the timestamp parameter.
